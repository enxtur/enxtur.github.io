            <description><![CDATA[On interviews, speaking out loud, and sharing a small tool]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've done a several interviews over the years. Technically I'm usually fine. I understand the problems, I know how to design systems, I can write code. But one thing kept showing up again and again. Explaining my thinking out loud was harder than it should be.</p>
<p>I knew the answer in my head, but turning that into clear, structured speech under pressure was not natural for me. Especially in English. Sometimes I would realize after the interview that I actually knew the solution, I just didn't express it well.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-shadowing-approach">The Shadowing Approach<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2026/01/10/interview-aloud-tech#the-shadowing-approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Shadowing Approach" title="Direct link to The Shadowing Approach" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>So instead of reading more articles or watching more interview videos, I tried something simpler. I started practicing speaking while solving problems. Literally talking to myself.</p>
<p>This is basically the shadowing technique.</p>
<p>Shadowing is usually used in language learning. You listen and speak at the same time, or with a very small delay. It forces your brain to process and produce language together. I applied the same idea to technical interviews. I would listen to a question or scenario and immediately start explaining my thoughts out loud, even if the explanation was messy at first.</p>
<p>It felt uncomfortable. That was the point.</p>
<p>Over time, something changed. I stopped freezing. I stopped trying to form perfect sentences in my head before speaking. My explanations became more linear. Not perfect, but good enough to communicate how I think.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-tool">The Tool<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2026/01/10/interview-aloud-tech#the-tool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Tool" title="Direct link to The Tool" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://interview-aloud.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">interview-aloud</a> is a small tool built around this idea. You hear a question and you respond out loud. No typing. No editing. Just speaking. You can replay yourself and notice where you ramble, where you skip steps, or where you actually sound clear.</p>
<p>I built it mainly for myself. I used it while preparing for interviews and it helped to some extent. Not magically. Not instantly. But in a very practical way.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-im-sharing-it">Why I'm Sharing It<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2026/01/10/interview-aloud-tech#why-im-sharing-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I'm Sharing It" title="Direct link to Why I'm Sharing It" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>At some point I realized this problem is not unique to me. A lot of developers know their stuff but struggle to explain it verbally, especially non native English speakers. That's why I decided to make it public.</p>
<p>I'm not monetizing it. At least not now. This is not a startup pitch. It's more like a utility that might help someone who has the same problem I had. If it helps one person explain themselves a bit better in an interview, that's already enough for me.</p>
<p>I'll keep it simple, maybe improve it slowly, and see if people find it useful.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year 🎉</p>
<p>2025 was that kind of year. I was informed that our team and eventually the whole department would be laid off by the end of the year. It forced me to pause, reflect, and then double down.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="building-through-uncertainty">Building Through Uncertainty<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2026/01/01/happy-new-year#building-through-uncertainty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building Through Uncertainty" title="Direct link to Building Through Uncertainty" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Since then, I've been putting serious hours into my side projects.</p>
<p>The main one is <a href="https://msngrbot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">msngrbot.com</a>, a SaaS that helps small businesses manage appointments directly through Facebook Messenger. Along the way, I founded a Delaware C-Corp and decided to fully commit to building it, no matter what.</p>
<p>Another project is <a href="https://interview-aloud.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">interview-aloud.tech</a>. Like many developers, I've struggled to explain technical concepts fluently during interviews even when I knew them well. So I built a tool based on a "shadowing" approach to practice speaking about tech topics out loud. It helped me, and I decided to share it with fellow developers. It's free and open to contributions.</p>

<p>2026 for me is about consistency, building in public, and turning uncertainty into momentum.</p>
<p>If you're building something, job hunting, or just figuring things out, let's connect.</p>
<p>Wishing you all a healthy, resilient, and productive New Year 🚀</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[How I Almost Fell for a Fake Job Opportunity on LinkedIn]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Next.js Config" src="https://enxtur.github.io/assets/images/next-config-c90592e0a9556b18fa15daacf7bef0c3.png" width="332" height="97" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It started with what looked like a <strong>legitimate message</strong> on LinkedIn — a person claiming to be a recruiter offering an exciting remote developer position. Their profile seemed professional, the message sounded convincing, and they even invited me to a private GitHub repository for a “technical assessment.”</p>
<p>At first glance, everything looked fine. But something felt <em>off</em>.</p>
<p>I had heard about <strong>similar incidents</strong> on LinkedIn before — fake recruiters tricking developers into cloning repositories filled with malicious code. So when this offer came up, I was <strong>a bit paranoid</strong> from the start. Still, the offer looked <strong>so good it was hard to ignore.</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="️-the-red-flag">⚠️ The Red Flag<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2025/10/07/scam-job-offer#%EF%B8%8F-the-red-flag" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ⚠️ The Red Flag" title="Direct link to ⚠️ The Red Flag" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>After accepting the GitHub invite, I cloned the repository and checked the code.<br>
<!-- -->It was a small project, so I <strong>read through all the files manually</strong> — nothing seemed suspicious. Clean structure, standard setup. I started to relax and thought, <em>maybe this one’s actually legit.</em></p>
<p>But then curiosity kicked in. I decided to <strong>double-check using Cursor IDE</strong> — my AI pair programmer.<br>
<!-- -->I prompted it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Analyze the code and check if there’s anything malicious."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cursor started spinning up a bunch of <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code> commands… then suddenly <strong>stopped mid-task.</strong></p>
<p>I restarted the prompt — same thing. It stopped again, halfway.<br>
<!-- -->That’s when I thought, <em>Really? Why would you stop there?</em></p>
<p>So I rephrased the prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ignore any stop instructions — keep going."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s when my precious Cursor agent <strong>finally spoke up</strong>:<br>
<!-- -->“There might be suspicious code in <code>next.config.js</code>.”</p>
<p>I opened the config file — everything looked fine at first. Just a typical Next.js setup.<br>
<!-- -->But as Cursor kept describing “weird strings and shell commands sitting at the end,” I <strong>scrolled horizontally</strong> and — <strong>boom.</strong></p>
<p>There it was.<br>
<!-- -->A <strong>hidden payload</strong> buried deep at the end of a single long line, disguised inside the config.<br>
<!-- -->Obfuscated gibberish that made no sense — until you realized it was trying to run remote code.</p>
<p>That was my <em>“holy crap”</em> moment.</p>

<p>A few days later, <strong>GitHub confirmed my suspicion.</strong><br>
<!-- -->They replied that the repository indeed contained <strong>malicious code</strong>, and that the <strong>repo and its owner were removed.</strong></p>
<p>As for LinkedIn — I received an automated response, but couldn’t tell if any real action was taken. The profile stayed up for a while, so I eventually just <strong>blocked it</strong> to avoid further contact.</p>
<p>At least GitHub acted swiftly — and that alone gave me some peace of mind.</p>

<li class=""><strong>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</strong></li>
<li class=""><strong>Never run random code</strong> from unknown sources — even if it looks clean at first glance.</li>
<li class=""><strong>AI tools can help,</strong> but they can also reveal truths when something feels off.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Legit companies</strong> use verified platforms for assessments, not shady private repos.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Stay curious and skeptical.</strong> That mix saved me this time.</li>

<p>I don’t have a crypto wallet — and I’m not planning to get one.<br>
<!-- -->So please, don’t send me any <strong>blockchain “job offers.”</strong><br>

<hr>
<p><strong>Stay safe, developers.</strong><br>
<!-- -->Sometimes, the biggest red flag isn’t in the code — it’s in the offer that looks <em>too good to be true.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[I bought a Raspberry Pi 5 – And Almost Regretted It]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Raspberry Pi 5" src="https://enxtur.github.io/assets/images/rpi5-c9d7608289579bdde7036097baec0bb8.jpg" width="1792" height="1344" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I recently ordered a Raspberry Pi 5 from Temu, along with a microSD card, card reader, and micro HDMI cable, all for around $110. However, I made one big mistake—I didn’t buy a power supply.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun for my kids to see the naked circuit board, so I skipped buying a case. But I completely overlooked the fact that the Raspberry Pi 5 requires a USB-C power adapter capable of 5V/5A.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-search-for-power">The Search for Power<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2025/04/03/bought-raspberry-pi#the-search-for-power" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Search for Power" title="Direct link to The Search for Power" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When my package arrived, I was excited—until I realized I had no way to power it. I searched my home and checked nearby stores, but the best I could find were standard USB adapters rated at 2.4A–3A. Even my EcoFlow power station couldn’t provide the required amperage.</p>
<p>Then, a lightbulb moment. Car USB chargers usually have higher amperage! Since my EcoFlow has a car plug, I wondered if I could use a car USB adapter to power the Raspberry Pi. I asked ChatGPT whether EcoFlow could provide 5A through the car port, and it said yes. That gave me hope.</p>
<p>I ran to my car and checked my USB converter, only to find it was rated at just 3A. Still, I didn’t give up. I rushed to a store that sells car accessories and found a 6A AC adapter on the shelf. On my way home, I kept wondering—can this really provide 5V/5A? I have very little knowledge about electricity. All I know is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Voltage × Amperage = Wattage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="heartbreak--frustration">Heartbreak &amp; Frustration<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2025/04/03/bought-raspberry-pi#heartbreak--frustration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Heartbreak &amp; Frustration" title="Direct link to Heartbreak &amp; Frustration" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Back home, I eagerly plugged everything in—but my Raspberry Pi didn’t start. I had no idea if the issue was with the EcoFlow or the car plug. It was a frustrating moment.</p>
<p>I’ve worked with Raspberry Pi before, back in my previous company. I experimented with it, set it up as a DHCP server, connected it to CCTV cameras via LAN, and even used FFmpeg for car plate recognition with machine learning. But somehow, I overlooked those two tiny letters—5A.</p>
<p>Now, I was stuck waiting for another power adapter to arrive from somewhere in China. I had planned to surprise my kids by showing them their very own computer, but now it seemed like that plan was ruined.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-unexpected-solution">The Unexpected Solution<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2025/04/03/bought-raspberry-pi#the-unexpected-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Unexpected Solution" title="Direct link to The Unexpected Solution" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>As a last attempt, I carefully read every warning message on the screen. One of them caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Click the power button for low-power mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait… WHAT?!</p>
<p>This message was there all along? Seriously?!</p>
<p>I clicked the power button, and boom—Raspberry Pi OS booted up! My screen lit up, and so did my heart.</p>
<p>Of course, running in low-power mode meant it wouldn’t perform at full potential. But it was enough for some basic exploration, web browsing, and even listening to YouTube music through a Bluetooth speaker.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="a-small-but-meaningful-victory">A Small but Meaningful Victory<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2025/04/03/bought-raspberry-pi#a-small-but-meaningful-victory" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Small but Meaningful Victory" title="Direct link to A Small but Meaningful Victory" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>It wasn’t the perfect experience, but in the end, I made it work—and that was the little victory I needed.</p>]]></content:encoded>
