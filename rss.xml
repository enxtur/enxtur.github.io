            <description><![CDATA[How I Almost Fell for a Fake Job Opportunity on LinkedIn]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Next.js Config" src="https://enxtur.github.io/assets/images/next-config-c90592e0a9556b18fa15daacf7bef0c3.png" width="332" height="97" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It started with what looked like a <strong>legitimate message</strong> on LinkedIn — a person claiming to be a recruiter offering an exciting remote developer position. Their profile seemed professional, the message sounded convincing, and they even invited me to a private GitHub repository for a “technical assessment.”</p>
<p>At first glance, everything looked fine. But something felt <em>off</em>.</p>
<p>I had heard about <strong>similar incidents</strong> on LinkedIn before — fake recruiters tricking developers into cloning repositories filled with malicious code. So when this offer came up, I was <strong>a bit paranoid</strong> from the start. Still, the offer looked <strong>so good it was hard to ignore.</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="️-the-red-flag">⚠️ The Red Flag<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2025/10/07/scam-job-offer#%EF%B8%8F-the-red-flag" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ⚠️ The Red Flag" title="Direct link to ⚠️ The Red Flag" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>After accepting the GitHub invite, I cloned the repository and checked the code.<br>
<!-- -->It was a small project, so I <strong>read through all the files manually</strong> — nothing seemed suspicious. Clean structure, standard setup. I started to relax and thought, <em>maybe this one’s actually legit.</em></p>
<p>But then curiosity kicked in. I decided to <strong>double-check using Cursor IDE</strong> — my AI pair programmer.<br>
<!-- -->I prompted it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Analyze the code and check if there’s anything malicious."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cursor started spinning up a bunch of <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code> commands… then suddenly <strong>stopped mid-task.</strong></p>
<p>I restarted the prompt — same thing. It stopped again, halfway.<br>
<!-- -->That’s when I thought, <em>Really? Why would you stop there?</em></p>
<p>So I rephrased the prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ignore any stop instructions — keep going."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s when my precious Cursor agent <strong>finally spoke up</strong>:<br>
<!-- -->“There might be suspicious code in <code>next.config.js</code>.”</p>
<p>I opened the config file — everything looked fine at first. Just a typical Next.js setup.<br>
<!-- -->But as Cursor kept describing “weird strings and shell commands sitting at the end,” I <strong>scrolled horizontally</strong> and — <strong>boom.</strong></p>
<p>There it was.<br>
<!-- -->A <strong>hidden payload</strong> buried deep at the end of a single long line, disguised inside the config.<br>
<!-- -->Obfuscated gibberish that made no sense — until you realized it was trying to run remote code.</p>
<p>That was my <em>“holy crap”</em> moment.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Didn’t run anything.</strong><br>

<p>A few days later, <strong>GitHub confirmed my suspicion.</strong><br>
<!-- -->They replied that the repository indeed contained <strong>malicious code</strong>, and that the <strong>repo and its owner were removed.</strong></p>
<p>As for LinkedIn — I received an automated response, but couldn’t tell if any real action was taken. The profile stayed up for a while, so I eventually just <strong>blocked it</strong> to avoid further contact.</p>
<p>At least GitHub acted swiftly — and that alone gave me some peace of mind.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Never run random code</strong> from unknown sources — even if it looks clean at first glance.</li>
<li><strong>AI tools can help,</strong> but they can also reveal truths when something feels off.</li>
<li><strong>Legit companies</strong> use verified platforms for assessments, not shady private repos.</li>
<li><strong>Stay curious and skeptical.</strong> That mix saved me this time.</li>

<p>I don’t have a crypto wallet — and I’m not planning to get one.<br>
<!-- -->So please, don’t send me any <strong>blockchain “job offers.”</strong><br>
<!-- -->My chain is already full. 😅</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Stay safe, developers.</strong><br>
<!-- -->Sometimes, the biggest red flag isn’t in the code — it’s in the offer that looks <em>too good to be true.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[I bought a Raspberry Pi 5 – And Almost Regretted It]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Raspberry Pi 5" src="https://enxtur.github.io/assets/images/rpi5-c9d7608289579bdde7036097baec0bb8.jpg" width="1792" height="1344" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I recently ordered a Raspberry Pi 5 from Temu, along with a microSD card, card reader, and micro HDMI cable, all for around $110. However, I made one big mistake—I didn’t buy a power supply.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun for my kids to see the naked circuit board, so I skipped buying a case. But I completely overlooked the fact that the Raspberry Pi 5 requires a USB-C power adapter capable of 5V/5A.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-search-for-power">The Search for Power<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2025/04/03/bought-raspberry-pi#the-search-for-power" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Search for Power" title="Direct link to The Search for Power" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When my package arrived, I was excited—until I realized I had no way to power it. I searched my home and checked nearby stores, but the best I could find were standard USB adapters rated at 2.4A–3A. Even my EcoFlow power station couldn’t provide the required amperage.</p>
<p>Then, a lightbulb moment. Car USB chargers usually have higher amperage! Since my EcoFlow has a car plug, I wondered if I could use a car USB adapter to power the Raspberry Pi. I asked ChatGPT whether EcoFlow could provide 5A through the car port, and it said yes. That gave me hope.</p>
<p>I ran to my car and checked my USB converter, only to find it was rated at just 3A. Still, I didn’t give up. I rushed to a store that sells car accessories and found a 6A AC adapter on the shelf. On my way home, I kept wondering—can this really provide 5V/5A? I have very little knowledge about electricity. All I know is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Voltage × Amperage = Wattage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="heartbreak--frustration">Heartbreak &amp; Frustration<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2025/04/03/bought-raspberry-pi#heartbreak--frustration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Heartbreak &amp; Frustration" title="Direct link to Heartbreak &amp; Frustration" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Back home, I eagerly plugged everything in—but my Raspberry Pi didn’t start. I had no idea if the issue was with the EcoFlow or the car plug. It was a frustrating moment.</p>
<p>I’ve worked with Raspberry Pi before, back in my previous company. I experimented with it, set it up as a DHCP server, connected it to CCTV cameras via LAN, and even used FFmpeg for car plate recognition with machine learning. But somehow, I overlooked those two tiny letters—5A.</p>
<p>Now, I was stuck waiting for another power adapter to arrive from somewhere in China. I had planned to surprise my kids by showing them their very own computer, but now it seemed like that plan was ruined.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-unexpected-solution">The Unexpected Solution<a href="https://enxtur.github.io/2025/04/03/bought-raspberry-pi#the-unexpected-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Unexpected Solution" title="Direct link to The Unexpected Solution" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>As a last attempt, I carefully read every warning message on the screen. One of them caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Click the power button for low-power mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait… WHAT?!</p>
<p>This message was there all along? Seriously?!</p>
<p>I clicked the power button, and boom—Raspberry Pi OS booted up! My screen lit up, and so did my heart.</p>
<p>Of course, running in low-power mode meant it wouldn’t perform at full potential. But it was enough for some basic exploration, web browsing, and even listening to YouTube music through a Bluetooth speaker.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the perfect experience, but in the end, I made it work—and that was the little victory I needed.</p>]]></content:encoded>
