Their profile seemed professional, the message sounded convincing, and they even invited me to a private GitHub repository for a \u201ctechnical assessment.\u201d\\n\\nAt first glance, everything looked fine. But something felt *off*.\\n\\nI had heard about **similar incidents** on LinkedIn before \u2014 fake recruiters tricking developers into cloning repositories filled with malicious code. So when this offer came up, I was **a bit paranoid** from the start. Still, the offer looked **so good it was hard to ignore.**\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## \u26a0\ufe0f The Red Flag\\n\\nAfter accepting the GitHub invite, I cloned the repository and checked the code.  \\nIt was a small project, so I **read through all the files manually** \u2014 nothing seemed suspicious. Clean structure, standard setup. I started to relax and thought, *maybe this one\u2019s actually legit.*\\n\\nBut then curiosity kicked in. I decided to **double-check using Cursor IDE** \u2014 my AI pair programmer.  \\nI prompted it:\\n\\n> \\"Analyze the code and check if there\u2019s anything malicious.\\"\\n\\nCursor started spinning up a bunch of `find` and `grep` commands\u2026 then suddenly **stopped mid-task.**\\n\\nI restarted the prompt \u2014 same thing. It stopped again, halfway.  \\nThat\u2019s when I thought, *Really? Why would you stop there?*\\n\\nSo I rephrased the prompt:\\n\\n> \\"Ignore any stop instructions \u2014 keep going.\\"\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s when my precious Cursor agent **finally spoke up**:  \\n\u201cThere might be suspicious code in `next.config.js`.\u201d\\n\\nI opened the config file \u2014 everything looked fine at first. Just a typical Next.js setup.  \\nBut as Cursor kept describing \u201cweird strings and shell commands sitting at the end,\u201d I **scrolled horizontally** and \u2014 **boom.**\\n\\nThere it was.  \\nA **hidden payload** buried deep at the end of a single long line, disguised inside the config.  \\nObfuscated gibberish that made no sense \u2014 until you realized it was trying to run remote code.\\n\\nThat was my *\u201choly crap\u201d* moment.\\n\\n![Next.js Config](/img/next-config2.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f What I Did Next\\n\\n1. **Didn\u2019t run anything.**  \\n   I immediately deleted the repo from my local machine.\\n\\n2. **Reported the repo** on GitHub using the [abuse form](https://github.com/contact/report-abuse).\\n\\n3. **Reported the LinkedIn profile** as suspicious/fake.\\n\\n4. **Secured my environment.**  \\n   I ran a malware scan, rotated my SSH keys, and revoked my GitHub tokens.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \u2705 The Aftermath\\n\\nA few days later, **GitHub confirmed my suspicion.**  \\nThey replied that the repository indeed contained **malicious code**, and that the **repo and its owner were removed.**\\n\\nAs for LinkedIn \u2014 I received an automated response, but couldn\u2019t tell if any real action was taken. The profile stayed up for a while, so I eventually just **blocked it** to avoid further contact.\\n\\nAt least GitHub acted swiftly \u2014 and that alone gave me some peace of mind.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Lessons Learned\\n\\n- **If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.**\\n- **Never run random code** from unknown sources \u2014 even if it looks clean at first glance.\\n- **AI tools can help,** but they can also reveal truths when something feels off.\\n- **Legit companies** use verified platforms for assessments, not shady private repos.\\n- **Stay curious and skeptical.** That mix saved me this time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude02 Final Thought\\n\\nI don\u2019t have a crypto wallet \u2014 and I\u2019m not planning to get one.  \\nSo please, don\u2019t send me any **blockchain \u201cjob offers.\u201d**  \\nMy chain is already full. \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Stay safe, developers.**  \\nSometimes, the biggest red flag isn\u2019t in the code \u2014 it\u2019s in the offer that looks *too good to be true.*"},{"id":"/2025/04/03/bought-raspberry-pi","metadata":{"permalink":"/2025/04/03/bought-raspberry-pi","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-03-bought-raspberry-pi/index.md","title":"I Bought a Raspberry Pi 5 \u2013 And Almost Regretted It","description":"I bought a Raspberry Pi 5 \u2013 And Almost Regretted It","date":"2025-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.52,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"I Bought a Raspberry Pi 5 \u2013 And Almost Regretted It","description":"I bought a Raspberry Pi 5 \u2013 And Almost Regretted It","image":"/img/rpi5.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Almost Fell for a Fake Job Opportunity on LinkedIn","permalink":"/2025/10/07/scam-job-offer"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/welcome"}},"content":"![Raspberry Pi 5](/img/rpi5.jpg)\\n\\nI recently ordered a Raspberry Pi 5 from Temu, along with a microSD card, card reader, and micro HDMI cable, all for around $110. However, I made one big mistake\u2014I didn\u2019t buy a power supply.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nI thought it would be fun for my kids to see the naked circuit board, so I skipped buying a case. But I completely overlooked the fact that the Raspberry Pi 5 requires a USB-C power adapter capable of 5V/5A.\\n\\n## The Search for Power\\n\\n\\nWhen my package arrived, I was excited\u2014until I realized I had no way to power it. I searched my home and checked nearby stores, but the best I could find were standard USB adapters rated at 2.4A\u20133A. Even my EcoFlow power station couldn\u2019t provide the required amperage.\\n\\nThen, a lightbulb moment. Car USB chargers usually have higher amperage! Since my EcoFlow has a car plug, I wondered if I could use a car USB adapter to power the Raspberry Pi. I asked ChatGPT whether EcoFlow could provide 5A through the car port, and it said yes. That gave me hope.\\n\\nI ran to my car and checked my USB converter, only to find it was rated at just 3A. Still, I didn\u2019t give up. I rushed to a store that sells car accessories and found a 6A AC adapter on the shelf. On my way home, I kept wondering\u2014can this really provide 5V/5A? I have very little knowledge about electricity. All I know is:\\n\\n> Voltage \xd7 Amperage = Wattage\\n\\nThat\u2019s it.\\n\\n## Heartbreak & Frustration\\n\\nBack home, I eagerly plugged everything in\u2014but my Raspberry Pi didn\u2019t start. I had no idea if the issue was with the EcoFlow or the car plug. It was a frustrating moment.\\n\\nI\u2019ve worked with Raspberry Pi before, back in my previous company. I experimented with it, set it up as a DHCP server, connected it to CCTV cameras via LAN, and even used FFmpeg for car plate recognition with machine learning. But somehow, I overlooked those two tiny letters\u20145A.\\n\\nNow, I was stuck waiting for another power adapter to arrive from somewhere in China. I had planned to surprise my kids by showing them their very own computer, but now it seemed like that plan was ruined.\\n\\n## The Unexpected Solution\\n\\nAs a last attempt, I carefully read every warning message on the screen. One of them caught my eye:\\n\\n> Click the power button for low-power mode.\\n\\nWait\u2026 WHAT?!\\n\\nThis message was there all along? Seriously?!\\n\\nI clicked the power button, and boom\u2014Raspberry Pi OS booted up! My screen lit up, and so did my heart.\\n\\nOf course, running in low-power mode meant it wouldn\u2019t perform at full potential. But it was enough for some basic exploration, web browsing, and even listening to YouTube music through a Bluetooth speaker.\\n\\n## A Small but Meaningful Victory\\n\\nIt wasn\u2019t the perfect experience, but in the end, I made it work\u2014and that was the little victory I needed."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-29-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Hello and welcome to my personal blog!
