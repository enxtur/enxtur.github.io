But for my current project it\'s still not enough, and the project isn\'t profitable yet to justify paying for more cache minutes or storage.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nI checked out some existing custom remote cache solutions, but almost every one requires you to bring your own S3 bucket, GCS, or some other cloud storage. That means extra infrastructure, credentials to manage, potential costs... just more moving parts I didn\'t want to deal with right now.\\n\\nThen I noticed Nx publishes a clean OpenAPI spec for their remote cache API. It looked straightforward enough \u2014 I figured I could implement a basic server that just uses the local filesystem in a day or two at most, without pulling me too far away from my actual work.\\n\\nSo that\'s what I ended up doing: [nx-caching-server](https://github.com/enxtur/nx-caching-server) (also published on Docker Hub as `enxtur/nx-caching-server`).\\n\\n### Why Go instead of Node/TS?\\nMy main stack is Node + TypeScript, but the API spec felt *perfect* for Go: clean structs, straightforward http handling, JSON without boilerplate.

Speaking forces clarity. That\u2019s why audio matters in this project.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The problem with built-in speech synthesis\\n\\nAt first, Interview Aloud relied entirely on the browser\u2019s built-in speech synthesis APIs. They\u2019re convenient and widely available, but in practice they come with some real issues:\\n\\n- The voice often sounds **robotic and unnatural**\\n- Quality varies **a lot** between browsers and operating systems\\n- The same content can sound completely different on a Mac, Windows machine, or mobile device\\n- Some voices are fast, some are flat, some are hard to follow\\n\\nThis inconsistency breaks the learning experience. When you\u2019re practicing interview answers, your brain is already busy structuring thoughts \u2014 fighting against poor audio quality doesn\u2019t help.\\n\\n## What I wanted instead\\n\\nI wanted audio that is:\\n\\n- More **human-like**\\n- **Consistent** across devices\\n- Predictable and controlled\\n- Available instantly without runtime surprises\\n\\nAt the same time, I didn\u2019t want to introduce runtime complexity, latency, or ongoing infrastructure costs just to play audio.\\n\\n## Choosing Google Cloud Text-to-Speech\\n\\nI decided to use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech for generating the audio.\\n\\nTwo reasons made it a good fit for this project:\\n\\n- The voices sound noticeably **more natural** than most built-in browser options\\n- The free tier is **very generous**, especially for a static-content use case like this\\n\\nSince Interview Aloud is mostly text-based and changes infrequently, this approach keeps costs low while still improving quality significantly.\\n\\n## The solution: pre-generated audio at build time\\n\\nInstead of generating audio on demand, everything happens during the build:\\n\\n- Audio is generated **at build time**\\n- Each interview topic maps to a deterministic audio file name\\n- Files are stored in the `public` directory and served statically\\n- If an audio file already exists, generation is **skipped**\\n- Playback always prefers the pre-generated audio\\n- Browser speech synthesis is kept as a **fallback** when audio files are missing\\n\\nThis makes the system very cost-effective:\\n\\n- No runtime API calls\\n- No repeated TTS requests for the same content\\n- No surprise bills from traffic spikes\\n\\nOnce an audio file exists, it\u2019s reused forever unless the content changes.\\n\\n## Refactoring without breaking things\\n\\nUnder the hood, the speech logic was refactored so that:\\n\\n1. Pre-generated audio is always checked first\\n2. Existing speech synthesis behavior remains intact\\n3. The rest of the app doesn\u2019t need to know which path is used\\n\\nThis keeps backward compatibility and makes the feature additive rather than disruptive.\\n\\n## Why this matters for interview practice\\n\\nInterviews are stressful partly because they\u2019re **spoken**, not written.  \\nHearing a clear, natural explanation \u2014 then responding out loud \u2014 helps train the right mental pathways.\\n\\nThis change isn\u2019t flashy, but it improves the core experience in a way that aligns closely with why Interview Aloud exists in the first place.\\n\\nMore consistency. Less friction. Better practice.\\n\\nThat\u2019s the goal."},{"id":"/2026/01/14/deploy-from-mobile","metadata":{"permalink":"/2026/01/14/deploy-from-mobile","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-14-deploy-from-mobile.md","title":"Shipping Production From My Phone","description":"A small moment that perfectly sums up modern dev workflows","date":"2026-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.29,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Shipping Production From My Phone","description":"A small moment that perfectly sums up modern dev workflows"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why I Added Pre-Generated Audio to Interview Aloud","permalink":"/2026/01/24/text-to-speech"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why I built interview-aloud","permalink":"/2026/01/10/interview-aloud-tech"}},"content":"I was out running some errands when I got an idea for a new topic for Interview Aloud.\\n\\nNothing fancy.

Technically I\'m usually fine. I understand the problems, I know how to design systems, I can write code. But one thing kept showing up again and again. Explaining my thinking out loud was harder than it should be.\\n\\nI knew the answer in my head, but turning that into clear, structured speech under pressure was not natural for me. Especially in English. Sometimes I would realize after the interview that I actually knew the solution, I just didn\'t express it well.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Shadowing Approach\\n\\nSo instead of reading more articles or watching more interview videos, I tried something simpler. I started practicing speaking while solving problems. Literally talking to myself.\\n\\nThis is basically the shadowing technique.\\n\\nShadowing is usually used in language learning. You listen and speak at the same time, or with a very small delay. It forces your brain to process and produce language together. I applied the same idea to technical interviews. I would listen to a question or scenario and immediately start explaining my thoughts out loud, even if the explanation was messy at first.\\n\\nIt felt uncomfortable. That was the point.\\n\\nOver time, something changed. I stopped freezing. I stopped trying to form perfect sentences in my head before speaking. My explanations became more linear. Not perfect, but good enough to communicate how I think.\\n\\n## The Tool\\n\\n[interview-aloud](https://interview-aloud.tech) is a small tool built around this idea. You hear a question and you respond out loud. No typing. No editing. Just speaking. You can replay yourself and notice where you ramble, where you skip steps, or where you actually sound clear.\\n\\nI built it mainly for myself. I used it while preparing for interviews and it helped to some extent. Not magically. Not instantly. But in a very practical way.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why I\'m Sharing It\\n\\nAt some point I realized this problem is not unique to me. A lot of developers know their stuff but struggle to explain it verbally, especially non native English speakers. That\'s why I decided to make it public.\\n\\nI\'m not monetizing it. At least not now. This is not a startup pitch. It\'s more like a utility that might help someone who has the same problem I had. If it helps one person explain themselves a bit better in an interview, that\'s already enough for me.\\n\\nI\'ll keep it simple, maybe improve it slowly, and see if people find it useful."},{"id":"/2026/01/01/happy-new-year","metadata":{"permalink":"/2026/01/01/happy-new-year","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-01-happy-new-year.md","title":"Happy New Year","description":"Reflecting on 2025 and looking forward to 2026","date":"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.98,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Happy New Year","description":"Reflecting on 2025 and looking forward to 2026"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why I built interview-aloud","permalink":"/2026/01/10/interview-aloud-tech"},"nextItem":{"title":"Almost Fell for a Fake Job Opportunity on LinkedIn","permalink":"/2025/10/07/scam-job-offer"}},"content":"Happy New Year \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n2025 was that kind of year.

However, I made one big mistake\u2014I didn\u2019t buy a power supply.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nI thought it would be fun for my kids to see the naked circuit board, so I skipped buying a case. But I completely overlooked the fact that the Raspberry Pi 5 requires a USB-C power adapter capable of 5V/5A.\\n\\n## The Search for Power\\n\\n\\nWhen my package arrived, I was excited\u2014until I realized I had no way to power it. I searched my home and checked nearby stores, but the best I could find were standard USB adapters rated at 2.4A\u20133A. Even my EcoFlow power station couldn\u2019t provide the required amperage.\\n\\nThen, a lightbulb moment. Car USB chargers usually have higher amperage! Since my EcoFlow has a car plug, I wondered if I could use a car USB adapter to power the Raspberry Pi. I asked ChatGPT whether EcoFlow could provide 5A through the car port, and it said yes. That gave me hope.\\n\\nI ran to my car and checked my USB converter, only to find it was rated at just 3A. Still, I didn\u2019t give up. I rushed to a store that sells car accessories and found a 6A AC adapter on the shelf. On my way home, I kept wondering\u2014can this really provide 5V/5A?

All I know is:\\n\\n> Voltage \xd7 Amperage = Wattage\\n\\nThat\u2019s it.\\n\\n## Heartbreak & Frustration\\n\\nBack home, I eagerly plugged everything in\u2014but my Raspberry Pi didn\u2019t start. I had no idea if the issue was with the EcoFlow or the car plug. It was a frustrating moment.\\n\\nI\u2019ve worked with Raspberry Pi before, back in my previous company. I experimented with it, set it up as a DHCP server, connected it to CCTV cameras via LAN, and even used FFmpeg for car plate recognition with machine learning. But somehow, I overlooked those two tiny letters\u20145A.\\n\\nNow, I was stuck waiting for another power adapter to arrive from somewhere in China. I had planned to surprise my kids by showing them their very own computer, but now it seemed like that plan was ruined.\\n\\n## The Unexpected Solution\\n\\nAs a last attempt, I carefully read every warning message on the screen.

My screen lit up, and so did my heart.\\n\\nOf course, running in low-power mode meant it wouldn\u2019t perform at full potential. But it was enough for some basic exploration, web browsing, and even listening to YouTube music through a Bluetooth speaker.\\n\\n## A Small but Meaningful Victory\\n\\nIt wasn\u2019t the perfect experience, but in the end, I made it work\u2014and that was the little victory I needed."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-29-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Hello and welcome to my personal blog!
