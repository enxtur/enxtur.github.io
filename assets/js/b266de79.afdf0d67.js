However, I made one big mistake\u2014I didn\u2019t buy a power supply.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nI thought it would be fun for my kids to see the naked circuit board, so I skipped buying a case. But I completely overlooked the fact that the Raspberry Pi 5 requires a USB-C power adapter capable of 5V/5A.\\n\\n## The Search for Power\\n\\n\\nWhen my package arrived, I was excited\u2014until I realized I had no way to power it. I searched my home and checked nearby stores, but the best I could find were standard USB adapters rated at 2.4A\u20133A. Even my EcoFlow power station couldn\u2019t provide the required amperage.\\n\\nThen, a lightbulb moment. Car USB chargers usually have higher amperage! Since my EcoFlow has a car plug, I wondered if I could use a car USB adapter to power the Raspberry Pi. I asked ChatGPT whether EcoFlow could provide 5A through the car port, and it said yes. That gave me hope.\\n\\nI ran to my car and checked my USB converter, only to find it was rated at just 3A. Still, I didn\u2019t give up. I rushed to a store that sells car accessories and found a 6A AC adapter on the shelf. On my way home, I kept wondering\u2014can this really provide 5V/5A? I have very little knowledge about electricity. All I know is:\\n\\n> Voltage \xd7 Amperage = Wattage\\n\\nThat\u2019s it.\\n\\n## Heartbreak & Frustration\\n\\nBack home, I eagerly plugged everything in\u2014but my Raspberry Pi didn\u2019t start. I had no idea if the issue was with the EcoFlow or the car plug. It was a frustrating moment.\\n\\nI\u2019ve worked with Raspberry Pi before, back in my previous company. I experimented with it, set it up as a DHCP server, connected it to CCTV cameras via LAN, and even used FFmpeg for car plate recognition with machine learning. But somehow, I overlooked those two tiny letters\u20145A.\\n\\nNow, I was stuck waiting for another power adapter to arrive from somewhere in China. I had planned to surprise my kids by showing them their very own computer, but now it seemed like that plan was ruined.\\n\\n## The Unexpected Solution\\n\\nAs a last attempt, I carefully read every warning message on the screen. One of them caught my eye:\\n\\n> Click the power button for low-power mode.\\n\\nWait\u2026 WHAT?!\\n\\nThis message was there all along? Seriously?!\\n\\nI clicked the power button, and boom\u2014Raspberry Pi OS booted up! My screen lit up, and so did my heart.\\n\\nOf course, running in low-power mode meant it wouldn\u2019t perform at full potential. But it was enough for some basic exploration, web browsing, and even listening to YouTube music through a Bluetooth speaker.\\n\\n## A Small but Meaningful Victory\\n\\nIt wasn\u2019t the perfect experience, but in the end, I made it work\u2014and that was the little victory I needed."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-29-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Hello and welcome to my personal blog!
